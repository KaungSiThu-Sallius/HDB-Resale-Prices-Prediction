# HDB Resale Price Prediction

## Motivation

I have been learning data science on DataCamp and enjoy working with Python, machine learning, and data visualization. This project is a great opportunity to apply my skills and integrate them into a meaningful project.

### Why HDB Flat Price Prediction?

1. Itâ€™s a real-world problem that affects many people in Singapore.
2. It allows me to use Python for data cleaning, building models, and making predictions.
3. It enables me to create a dashboard using Python's Plotly library to present results in an easily understandable manner.

This project is also crucial for my career aspirations as I aim to work in Singapore. Through this project, I hope to:

1. Demonstrate my ability to use data science to solve practical problems.
2. Build a strong portfolio to stand out in job applications.

## Project Overview

### Project Goal

To build a predictive model for HDB resale prices and implement the results on a Python Plotly Dashboard.

### Data Sources

- **HDB Resale Dataset:** [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/collections/189/view)
- **Geospatial Data API:** [OneMap API](https://www.onemap.gov.sg/apidocs/)

### Expected Outcomes

- Provide insights to help buyers and sellers understand fair market prices.
- Analyze the impact of location and other factors on HDB resale prices.

### Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn):** Data cleaning and machine learning modeling.
- **Plotly Dash:** Visualization of trends and creation of an interactive dashboard.

## Timeline

| Week  | Tasks |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Week 1 | Collect and clean HDB resale data from government website. Fetch geospatial data using OneMap API. |
| Week 2 | Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns. Train and optimize machine learning models. |
| Week 3 | Build a Plotly dashboard to visualize HDB price trends and predictions. Test and refine the dashboard for usability. |
| Week 4 | Prepare for production. |

## Expected Outcomes

### Core Deliverables

1. A machine learning model to predict HDB resale prices based on features like town, flat type, and floor area.
2. An interactive Plotly dashboard displaying:
   - **Price trends over time**
   - **Heatmaps of HDB prices across Singapore**
   - **Key factors influencing prices (e.g., proximity to MRT stations)**

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate Flask to develop a web-based interface for the model.
- Implement real-time data updates from APIs.
- Enhance the model by incorporating additional features like interest rates and government policies.
